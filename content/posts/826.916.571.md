I have set up this blog as a journal for my ongoing learning journey.

My learning objectives can belong to the three following streams:

    * Cybersecurity
    * Data Science
    * Computer Science / Software Engineering

And *I do realize that is not very specific*.

I am fortunate enough to be currently enrolled in a (rather peculiar) position, right into the intersection between the fields of data science/machine learning and cybersecurity. And that is something far more exciting than what I could have hoped as a computer engineering fresh graduate.

While I am heavily attracted to both fields, truth is that for the last few years the focus of my self-learning has been on machine learning. I am not as well-versed in cybersecurity as I would like to be.

Becoming knowledgeable enough at the main subfields of cybersecurity is a priority.

On the other hand, I must keep educating myself in the data science and machine learning fields, where I am pretty much submerged during my daily work.

Lastly, keeping my programming skills sharp seems like a smart move: most of the value I have provided has originated from improving and optimizing existing codebases applying more traditional software engineering techniques.
